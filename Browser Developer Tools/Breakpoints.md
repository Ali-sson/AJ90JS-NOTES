2. **Breakpoints:**
   - **Purpose:** Breakpoints help developers pause the execution of JavaScript code at specific points, allowing them to inspect the program's state, variables, and call stack.
   - **Features:**
     - **Line-of-Code Breakpoints:** You can set breakpoints at specific lines of code to pause execution when the program reaches those lines.
     - **Conditional Breakpoints:** Set breakpoints that will only trigger if a specified condition is met.
     - **Function Breakpoints:** Pause execution when a specific function is called.
     - **DOM Breakpoints:** Pause execution when a particular DOM element is modified.
     - **XHR/Fetch Breakpoints:** Pause execution when an XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API call is made.
   - **How to Access:** In the "Sources" tab of DevTools, you can set breakpoints by clicking on the line number of the code you want to break on. Alternatively, you can use the "Debugger" tab for more advanced debugging features.

Both the Console and Breakpoints are essential tools for web developers. The Console helps diagnose issues, log information, and interact with the code, while Breakpoints facilitate a more in-depth inspection of the code during execution. They are fundamental for debugging and optimizing web applications.
