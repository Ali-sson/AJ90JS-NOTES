Browser Developer Tools (DevTools) are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into modern web browsers. They provide developers with a wide range of features to inspect, debug, and optimize web applications. Two key components of browser DevTools are the Console and Breakpoints.

1. **Console:**
   - **Purpose:** The Console is a powerful tool for logging information, debugging, and interacting with the JavaScript code running on a web page.
   - **Features:**
     - **Logging:** You can use `console.log()`, `console.error()`, `console.warn()`, and other methods to log messages to the console.
     - **Interactive JavaScript:** You can type and execute JavaScript commands directly in the console, which is useful for testing code snippets.
     - **Network Monitoring:** View network requests made by the page, including their status, size, and timing.
     - **Error Tracking:** Displays error messages, warnings, and other information generated by the JavaScript code.
     - **Event Monitoring:** Allows you to monitor and log events.
   - **How to Access:** Right-click on a web page, select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element," and navigate to the "Console" tab.
