`async/await` is a syntactic feature in JavaScript that simplifies working with asynchronous code. It was introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) and provides a more concise and readable way to write asynchronous code compared to using Promises and callbacks.

Here's a basic example demonstrating the use of `async/await`:

```javascript
// Asynchronous function using async/await
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from an API)
    let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    
    // Parsing the response as JSON
    let data = await response.json();
    
    // Logging the data
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handling errors
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

// Calling the asynchronous function
fetchData();
```

In this example:

- The `async` keyword is used before the function declaration to indicate that the function contains asynchronous code.
- Inside the function, the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the asynchronous operation (in this case, the `fetch` call) is complete. This makes the code look more like synchronous code, improving readability.
- The `try/catch` block is used to handle errors. If any of the promises returned by the `await` expressions are rejected, the control will jump to the `catch` block.

`async/await` is often used with Promises, making it a powerful and concise way to handle asynchronous operations. It's widely adopted in modern JavaScript code for its readability and ease of use in managing asynchronous flows.
